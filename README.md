### If you are using our dataset immatrix_2D.npy, you can simply run the python code to train the model by:
python3 main.py --batch_size 32 

### If you are using your own dataset, you might need to specify the number of frames for the input to train the model by:
python3 main.py --batch_size 32
                --numframe N

### To download our pre-trained model, please download and save it as './model/...' separately from the link below:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/9phk9osmzzpbh66/model.zip?dl=0

### and then run prediction.ipynb to play around with your own input!
